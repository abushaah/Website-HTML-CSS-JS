        <h4>Tort Law</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The tort is harm caused to a person or property that can create a civil action. It can be classified as either intentional torts or unintentional torts.</li><br>
            <ol>
                <li>Negligence and unintentional tort
                    <ul>
                        <li>Unintentional tort are injuries caused by an accident or action that was NOT intended to cause harm.</li>
                        <li>Negligence is careless actions that harm someone, however, the harm was foreseeable.</li>
                        <li>There are three factors that must be present for a case to be considered negligence and unintentional tort:
                            <ol>
                                <li>Duty of Care - the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty of care.</li>
                                <li>Standard of Care - determining how much care the defendant owes.</li>
                                <li>Causation - the plaintiff must prove that the actions of the defendant actually caused their injuries.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li><br>
                <li>Intentional tort
                    <ul>
                        <li>Intentional torts are actions purposely done to cause injury to others.</li>
                        <li>The same event can result in two distinct consequences:</li>
                        <li>Criminal law - bringing the accused to justice.</li>
                        <li>Civil law - to compensate victims.</li>
                    </ul>
