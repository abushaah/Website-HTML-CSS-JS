        <ul>
            <li>Crime is an act or omission of an act that is prohibited and punishable by a federal statute.</li><br>
            <li>The purpose of criminal laws is to protect people and property, maintain order, and preserve standards of public decency.</li><br>
            <li>Four conditions must exist for an act or omission to be considered a crime:
                <ol>
                    <li>The act is considered wrong by society.</li>
                    <li>The act causes harm to society in general or to those who need protection.</li>
                    <li>The harm must be serious.</li>
                    <li>The remedy must be handled by the criminal justice system.</li>
                </ol>
            </li><br>
            <li>Elements of a crime

                    <li><p class="elements">Actus reus</p> is the “the guilty act” itself, such as the voluntary action, omission, or state of being that is forbidden by the criminal code.</li>
                    <li>
                        <p class="elements">Mens rea</p> is the deliberate intention to commit a wrongful act, with reckless disregard for the consequences.

        <ul>

            <li>Parties to an offence: are people not directly involved in the crime but considered partly responsible for it.
                <ol>
                    <li>Aiding: helping the perpetrator commit the crime.</li>
                    <li>Abetting: encouraging the perpetrator to commit the crime.</li>
                    <li>Counselling: advising, recommending, or persuading another person to commit a crime.</li>
                    <li>Accessory after the fact: someone who knowingly assists a perpetrator in escaping from the police.</li>
                    <li>Party to a common intention: the shared responsibility among criminals for any additional offences that are committed in the course of the crime they originally intend to commit.</li>

                    <li>Attempt: the intention to commit a crime, even if the attempt is unsuccessful or not completed. The Crown or Prosecution has to show the accused had the necessary intent and took steps towards committing the crime.</li>

            <li>Summary offences are minor or less serious offences (careless driving). They are dealt with quickly and held in a Provincial court before a judge. [Sentence = $2,000 or 6 months in jail].</li><br>
            <li>Indictable offences are more serious offences (murder, robbery). The trial is held in Provincial or Superior court, depending on severity, before a judge or a judge and jury. [Sentence = 2 years to life in prison].</li><br>
            <li>Hybrid offences are a summary or inductive offence, depending on circumstances (theft under $5,000, dangerous operation of a vehicle). They are treated as indictable until the court decides it is a summary offence by looking at the type of offences and criminal past of the accused.</li>
