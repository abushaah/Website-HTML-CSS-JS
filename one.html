        <h4>Defences of the court</h4>
        <h5>Defence is either the denial of having committed a crime or a justification for the act. If the accused acknowledges they committed the crime but have a good reason, they must offer proof.</h5>

        <ul>
            <li><p class="elements">Defence</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Mental States: a mental disorder where the accused cannot be held responsible (no mens rea).
                        <ul>The defence counsel must show either:
                            <li>the accused did not know what they were doing, or;</li>
                            <li>the accused did not know the act was wrong.</li>
                            If accepted, the accused may be set free or sent to a psychiatric hospital.
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Automatism: the accused acts without being aware of what they are doing (no actus reus).</li>
                    <li>Intoxication: the condition of being overpowered by drugs or alcohol to the point of losing self-control. This defence only reduces the charge from a specific intent crime to a general intent crime.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><p class="elements">Justifications</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Self-Defence: defence from an unprovoked attack. The force has to be reasonable and can only be enough to fend off the attack.</li>
                    <li>Battered Woman Syndrome: the effects of prolonged spousal abuse.</li>
                    <li>Defence of a Dwelling: a person can defend their dwelling from any unlawful entry and remove a trespasser if they have entered. The force used must be reasonable.</li>
                    <li>Necessity: the accused had no other choice or opportunity for alternative action but to commit the criminal act.</li>
                    <li>Compulsion or Duress: the accused was forced to commit a criminal act against their will by threat of violence. This defence cannot be used as a defence for violent crimes (murder, sexual assault, robbery, or assault with a weapon).</li>
                    <li>Provocation: any act or insult that causes someone to lose control.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><p class="elements">Other defences</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Mistake of Law: the ignorance of the law where the accused relied on incorrect legal advice from a law enforcement official.</li>
                    <li>Mistake of Fact: the accused made an honest mistake that led to the breaking of the law (no mens rea).</li>
                    <li>Double Jeopardy: an accused person cannot be tried twice for the same offence, even if new evidence is discovered after the <abbr title="An acquittal is a decision in a criminal trail that the accused in not guilty">acquittal</abbr>.</li>
                    <li>Alibi: the accused claims that they were somewhere else when the offence was committed.</li>
                    <li>Entrapment: police conduct that illegally induces criminal behaviour.</li>        
                </ol>
            </li>
